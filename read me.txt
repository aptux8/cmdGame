purpose desighn a templet

each decision will be its own batch file called a loop
the goal is to use these loops to navigate to the same
area in the game multiple times.

:# geography
tunnel with 3 pasages

train blocking / boarding


spill way

mountain pass

tree


:# problem solving

read me to be found

book

:# in order to pick up an object
a math function might be used // unable to move data from one loop to the next

a seperate path with different objects. ie copy paste l01 / l01Light / l01LightRope
creates a lot of extra files
creating each loop withen a folder and combining them at the end may cut clutter
